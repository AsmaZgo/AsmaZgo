### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You can call me AsmaZgo! I'm a Senior Machine Learning engineer with 6 years of experience in data science and big data engineering. I'm skilled in building and deploying complex models for a variety of applications, and experienced in managing and analyzing
large datasets. I'm also passionate about using data science and analytics to solve real-world problems.

-- ðŸ‘¯ I'm enjoying collaboration with the Apache Spark community and Iâ€™m looking to collaborate more on open source Machine Learning projects. Reach out to me if you have project ideas ;)
